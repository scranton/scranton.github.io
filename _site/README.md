This is the source of my personal website http://scott.cranton.com/. The only interesting branch in this repo will be the source branch as GitHub expects the generated website to live in master.

Steps to publish:

* Make changes in the source branch
* Build and test the site locally
* Commit changes to source branch
* `git publish-website` which consists of the following steps
    * `git branch -D master`
    * `git checkout -b master`
    * `git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter _site/ -f --`
    * `git checkout source`
    * `git push --all origin`
