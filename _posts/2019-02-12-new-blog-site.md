I finally got around to updating my blog site to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
I'm still looking at other static web site generators like [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

A lot has happened since the last time I posted. Currntly I'm working at [Solo.io](https://solo.io) leading their
emerging Customer Success team. Its a small, and very promising startup in the microservices gateway, and service mesh
space. I'm very excited to be there, especially as I'm getting back hands on with code and technology again. Yay!

My hope is to get back into blogging and writing, so hopefully you see new posts and such appearing here soon.
